## üöÄ Core Features

### ‚úÖ Login & Verification Code
- Uses **Redis** to store verification codes
- Supports **SMS-based login**, stores login information in Redis and generates token

### ‚úÖ User Information Caching
- Handles **cache penetration** and **cache breakdown** using **mutex locks + logical expiration**

### ‚úÖ Nearby Shop Location
- Uses **Redis GEO** features to implement nearby shop recommendation

### ‚úÖ Flash Sale System
- Leverages **Redis + Lua scripting** to verify flash sale eligibility
- Uses **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous order processing, avoiding **overselling** and **duplicate orders**



## Optimization 1: Login Module
Current Implementation: Using personal user email to send verification codes via SMTP protocol.

## Optimization 2: Flash Sale (Seckill) Enhancement
High Concurrency Solution: Implemented RabbitMQ message queue to optimize flash sale order processing, significantly reducing database pressure.

### Uses Lua scripts to ensure atomic execution of:
Inventory availability check
User order verification
Inventory deduction
Order creation and user event saving
Asynchronous Processing: Leverages RabbitMQ for asynchronous handling of high-concurrency requests.

## Optimization 3: Rate Limiting Implementation
Token Bucket Algorithm: Applied to control request rates during flash sale events.
